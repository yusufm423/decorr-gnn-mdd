# Brain Augmented Decorrelated Network (BrainADNet) 

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) poses a signif-
icant neurological challenge. The establishment of an accurate
diagnostic model for individuals with MDD, particularly those
experiencing varying episodes, is a critical yet challenging task,
given that treatment and medication protocols differ substantially
across patients. This project proposes the Brain Augmented-
Decorrelated Network (BrainADNet), a graph based framework
using Graph Machine Learning to diagnose MDD cases with
single and multiple episodes. BrainADNet addresses data scarcity
by augmenting brain signals and integrating critical demographic
information like age, education and gender. Using Graph Neural
Networks (GNN), this framework captures distinct higher-order
brain connectivity features, achieving superior performance com-
pared to existing models. Our findings identify the top 10 brain
regions important for prediction and reveals distinct connectivity
pattens between single and multiple episode cases. By enhancing
diagnostic precision and providing information on gender-specific
preventive strategies, these insights make it possible to provide
therapy that is both early and successful.
